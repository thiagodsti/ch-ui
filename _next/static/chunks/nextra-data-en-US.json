You know ClickHouse, that super-fast database system that can crunch through tons of data like it's nothing? Well, CH-UI is basically a fancy dress for ClickHouse. It's a UI that makes ClickHouse easy to use via a web browser.","why-did-i-create-it#Why did I create it?":"Here's the thing... ClickHouse is amazing, but when you have a project, or a group of people, or even if you want your super unicorn start-up to be able to use \"BIG-DATA, AI-DRIVEN, DATA-DRIVEN\" solutions, data needs to be accessible to everyone. Queries need to be easy to write, and results need to be easy to understand, see, and get insights from... ClickHouse itself offers a cloud-based solution, and I really recommend it. They even give you free credits and LOTS of features...After using their cloud solution, I was amazed by all the features and the speed of the database, but the time had come. It was 26 days into my trial... The clock was ticking!Then the thought:\n\"How am I going to leave without an answer for my NYC taxi ride questions!? I CAN'T LOSE MY DATA!!! What if I don't have time to figure out how many rides from Brooklyn to the airport happened?!\"\nI couldn't bear not knowing! And that's why I couldn't lose my data.\nTHE IDEA! - What if I could create a UI that connects to ClickHouse, then\nself-host it on my own and have all the taxi data I wanted forever?!\nWell, that's how CH-UI was born! üöÄ","what-can-you-do-with-ch-ui#What can you do with CH-UI?":"Clearly, the main goal is to see all the taxi rides from Brooklyn to the airport... BUT if you want to do anything else, even though I don't see the point... You can:\nBrowse your databases and tables on the data explorer.\nWrite and run queries with a nice SQL editor.\nView your data in tables, filter, sort, and export it.\nGet insights from your data much easier.\nSee your instance metrics.","final-thoughts#Final thoughts...":"I really hope this can be a true solution for anyone who wants to start with ClickHouse, or even for those who already self-host it and want a better way to interact with the data...I also hope that technical people who use CH-UI get involved in the project so it can grow to be better... Personally, I think data is extremely valuable for EVERYONE, not just big companies that can pay, or people who are starting to learn. I truly believe that we should be able to create solutions as a community, and I want to see all kinds of companies, professionals, and students using CH-UI and having a really good experience with it.So, that's it for now! I hope you enjoy using CH-UI as much as I enjoyed creating it. And remember, if you have any questions, feedback, or just want to chat about ClickHouse, feel free to reach out! üöÄ"}},"/blog/posts":{"title":"Index","data":{}},"/blog/posts/why-i-couldnt-lose-my-data":{"title":"Why I couldn't Lose My Data!","data":{"":"Ever wondered how often Brooklynites make a break for the airport?

Application State Management":"CH-UI utilizes Zustand for efficient and straightforward state management. The central state store forms the backbone of the application's data flow.","key-features#Key Features":"ClickHouse Client Integration: A ClickHouse client instance is maintained in the state, facilitating seamless communication with the ClickHouse server.\nCredential Management: User credentials for ClickHouse are securely stored and managed within the state.\nWorkspace Persistence: The current state of all open tabs and workspaces is maintained, enabling a persistent and responsive user interface.\nState updates are performed using actions defined in the store, allowing components to easily access and modify the application state. This centralized approach ensures consistency across the application and simplifies data flow management.","2-workspace-and-tabs#2. Workspace and Tabs":"The CH-UI workspace is built around a flexible tab system, allowing users to manage multiple queries or views simultaneously.","key-features-1#Key Features":"Dynamic Tab Creation: Users can create new tabs for various content types (SQL queries, information views, etc.).\nTab Persistence: Tabs are persisted using IndexedDB, allowing work recovery across sessions.\nTab Management: Users can reorder, rename, and close tabs as needed.\nThis tab system provides a familiar and efficient interface for users to organize their work. It allows for multitasking and easy navigation between different queries or database views, enhancing productivity in database management tasks.","3-database-explorer#3. Database Explorer":"The Database Explorer provides a hierarchical view of ClickHouse databases and tables, enhancing navigation and data discovery.","key-features-2#Key Features":"Tree Structure: Databases and tables are displayed in an expandable tree structure.\nSearch Functionality: Users can search for specific databases or tables.\nReal-time Refresh: The explorer can be refreshed to fetch the latest database structure.\nThis component serves as the primary navigation tool for users to explore their ClickHouse databases. It provides an intuitive interface for users to understand the structure of their data and quickly access specific tables or databases.","4-query-execution-and-big-data-handling#4. Query Execution and Big Data Handling":"Query execution is a core feature of CH-UI, designed to handle large datasets efficiently.","key-aspects#Key Aspects":"Query Execution: Queries are sent to the ClickHouse server using the @clickhouse/client-web library.\nResult Processing: Query results are processed and stored in the application state or IndexedDB, depending on their size.\nLarge Dataset Management: CH-UI uses a combination of chunked data retrieval, IndexedDB storage, and virtualized rendering for efficient big data handling.","big-data-handling-strategies#Big Data Handling Strategies":"Chunked Data Retrieval:\nLarge query results are retrieved in manageable chunks to prevent memory overflow. This allows the application to handle queries that return massive datasets without overwhelming the browser's memory.\nIndexedDB for Large Datasets:\nQuery results exceeding a size threshold are stored in IndexedDB instead of in-memory state. This strategy enables the application to work with datasets that are too large to fit in memory, providing a seamless experience even with big data.\nVirtualized Rendering:\nLarge datasets are rendered using virtualization techniques, displaying only the visible portion of the data. This significantly improves performance when dealing with tables containing thousands or millions of rows.\nBy implementing these strategies, CH-UI provides a robust solution for working with big data in a web-based ClickHouse client. Users can execute complex queries on large datasets and interact with the results smoothly, making it suitable for data analysis and exploration tasks on substantial ClickHouse databases.These core concepts work together to create a powerful, efficient, and user-friendly interface for ClickHouse database management. The application's architecture ensures smooth handling of large datasets, responsive user interactions, and persistent workspace management, catering to the needs of data professionals working with ClickHouse databases."}},"/docs/getting-started":{"title":"Getting Started üöÄ","data":{"":"Let's get you up and running with CH-UI in no time.","prerequisites#Prerequisites":"A running ClickHouse server instance.
